This is a project made using Java applets and MySQL creating an allround experience of Bank Management. Both for the bank admins and the users who have accounts in this bank. There are options available like view transactions, create,freeze accounts etc. For users here we have options like show statement, apply for a passbook etc. All in all this helps enhance our understanding of OOPs concepts in java as well as JDBC.
